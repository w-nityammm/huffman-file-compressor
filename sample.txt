How to make methamphetamine

# You're going to need:

• Muriatic acid (diluted HCl), you can find it in the pool section of your closest hardware store

• Lye (NaOH)

• Diethyl ether, or simply just ether, can be found in engine starting fluid, make sure to look for one which says "high (di)ethyl ether content"

• (Pseudo)ephedrine, found in decongestive pills, I'll explain which ones to look out for later

• *Distilled* water, as previously stated, any contaminants will reduce the purity

• Red phosphorus, found in matchboxes on the striking surface, a lot of it is needed so I suggest you buy bigger packs in order to save on money

• A flask or a small pot with a lid

• Iodine

• Hydroiodic Acid (process of getting it is down below)

• Toluene and HCI gas (we're going to use them for crystalizing the meth)

• Sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate, most likely they won't be needed but it's best to have them on you just in case

• A glass eyedropper

• 3 small glass bottles with lids, preferably 3oz (~90 ml), at least one has to be clear and another one should be marked at 1.5oz (~45 ml)

• A meatloaf glass dish

• A glass quart (~950 ml) jar

• Sharp scissors/knife

• *Clean* rubber gloves

• A gas mask, in case something goes wrong

• Filter paper (coffee filters will do)

• A measuring cup

• Measuring spoons

# Extracting our ingredients:

# Ether:

BE CAREFUL, ether is very flammable heavier than air and an anaesthetic. Do NOT use it near flame or other sources of heat which could set it on fire, such as sparks. Do NOT inhale it, inhaling too much of it can cause respiratory collapse.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it's about half-full. Fill the rest of it with water, put the lid back on and shake it for 5 minutes. Leave it alone for a couple of minutes, then tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, using the eyedropper, take the upper layer (ether), and throw away the lower and cloudy layer.

Place the ether in the marked container. Rinse and repeat until you get around 1,5oz of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Note that ether is very pungent, it has a very intense smell. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable.

# (Pseudo)ephedrine:

Pure ephedrine can be extracted out plants from the *Ephedra* genus, some of which can be bought at most garden stores.

Most people, however, prefer to work with pseudoephedrine extracted from decongestive pills.

The pills you want have to be nearly pure pseudoephedrine HCl. Buy only the ones which have pseudoephedrine as the ONLY active ingredient.

Also, check the label to see what inactive ingredients they contain. These are the flavors and binders present in the pill, since they'll mess up the purity you'll have to remove them.

Keep an eye out for pills with:

• red coating

• a lot of cellulose

• a lot of wax

• povidone

They are very difficult to remove and not worth the effort.

In case there are two pills which contain the same amount of pseudo, use the smaller since you'll have to deal with less inactive ingredients for the same result.

Avoid time released pills. They have more binders and tend to gel up, so it's best to avoid them entirely.

# Now, before we move on to the other ingredients, do the following:

Pour 1/8 teaspoon (~0,6 ml) of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate.

BE CAREFUL, the mixture will become hot and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, so, as previously stated, avoid any flames.

Repeat this until the mixture becomes cloudy. We are doing this so we can neutralize the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free-base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. By doing this we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities.

Fill the clear bottle the rest of the way with ether. Put the lid back on and agitate for around 8 minutes. You have to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether so it can dissolve in it.

Wait until the mixture settles. The reason why you've been using a clear bottle is so you could notice that the layer in the middle is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible.

Remove the top layer (ether) with the eyedropper (do NOT to get any of the middle layer in it). Place the removed ether into a third bottle.

Fill the third bottle half-way with water and add 5 drops of muriatic acid. Put the lid back on and shake it for 2 minutes. Wait until it settles, then remove the top layer and throw it away. The free-base has bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities.

Get rid of ALL the ether before proceeding.

Now, evaporate the solution in the meatloaf dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or in the microwave (not reccommended because it can result in uneven heating, but you can use it if you have no alternatives). Be careful of any splashing.

If you're microwaving it, don't do it for more than 5s at a time. If it starts popping, that means you there's too little liquid left to microwave.

Now, we are going to make methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with hydroiodic acid and red phosphorus.

# Red phosphorus:

The striking pad on matchboxes is about 50% red phosphorus.

The way you can get red phosphorus is simply taking a sharp knife and scraping the striking pads off of the matchboxes.

Along with the red phosphorus, matchboxes are made up of about antimony sulfide and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. These contaminants shouldn't seriously interfere with the reaction, so we aren't going to bother with removing them.

Of course, this is a long and tedious process, so you might want to make sure you have no arrangements for the evening.

# Hydroiodic Acid:

Hydroiodic acid is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus.

Making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus will create a lot of heat, so chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. Add 150 grams (~1/3 lbs) of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300ml (~10.15 oz) of water.

When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, after preparing it wait for 20 minutes, allow it to complete its reaction before proceeding to the next step.

# Now, on to the making of actual methamphetamine:

Fill a 1000 ml round bottom flask with 150 g of ephedrine. After that, add the mixture we prepared in the previous step. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution that we need to proceed.

After you've mixed the ingredients in the flask, attach a condenser to the flask and boil the mixture for a day. While it is cooking, the mixture should be red, which is because of the red phosphorus that's floating around it. After the one day of boiling has passed, allow the flask to cool before diluting it with an equal volume of water.

Next, filter out the red phosphorus. A series of doubled up coffee filter should do the trick, however, real filter paper is still reccommended. The filtered solution should be colored golden. If it's still red, keep on filtering it, it just means the red phosphorus is still in there.

Don't throw out any red phosphorus that you filter out, you can still use it in your next batch.

In case the filtering does not get rid of the red color, it could mean that iodine is floating around the solution. You can get rid of it by adding a bit of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.

Now it's time to neutralize the acid.

Mix up a strong lye solution and add it to the batch. Shake the batch until it's strongly basic.This will bring out the meth as liquid free base floating on top of the water. Shake the basic solution to make sure that the meth has entirely converted to the free base.

# Now, on to the crystalizing.

First, add a few hundred mls of toluene to the batch, and the meth free-base extracted out as usual. If your cooking has been careful so far, the color of the extract should be clear to pale yellow.

If that is the case, congratulations! Your product is pure enough to make clear white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the extract. Don't worry if it's darker colored, all you have to do is distill it in order to get the pure methamphetamine free-base.

After you're done, you should be looking at around 100 grams (~3.5 oz) of pure methamphetamine crystals.
